# MBTI_expert_ststem

# Personality Test README

This Python script is designed to conduct a personality test based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) model. It prompts users with a series of questions and then determines their personality type based on their responses.

## Usage
To run the script, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. Then, execute the script using the following command:
instal experta with 'pip install experta'
write "./index.py"


Follow the on-screen instructions to answer each question by selecting either 'A' or 'B' based on your preference.

## Description

The script follows the MBTI model, which categorizes individuals into one of 16 personality types based on four dichotomies:

1. **Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I)**
2. **Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N)**
3. **Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F)**
4. **Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P)**

Upon completion, the script provides a description of the user's personality type along with a brief overview of the characteristics associated with that type.

## Dependencies

This script requires the `experta` library, which is a rule-based expert system engine for Python. You can install it via pip:
instal experta with 'pip install experta'
